# Expense Management Feature Roadmap

This document outlines the planned phases for the full implementation of the Expense Management feature in the Dutch Payroll System. Currently, Phase 1 (Mock Implementation) has been completed.

## Phase 1: Mock Implementation (Completed)

**Objective:** To provide a fully functional frontend UI for expense management using mock data, allowing for early user feedback and design validation without requiring backend changes.

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Frontend UI for submitting new expenses (expense type, amount, date, description, receipt upload).
- Display of expense summary cards (Total, Approved, Pending).
- List of submitted expenses with status, details, and mock receipt download/view options.
- Integration into the employee portal sidebar under "My Finances" -> "Expenses & Refunds".
- Removal of duplicate "Contracts" section and consolidation into "Documents".
- Refactoring of React Hooks to ensure stable UI functionality.

## Phase 2: Backend Integration - Database & API Development

**Objective:** To establish a robust backend infrastructure for storing and managing real expense data, and to provide API endpoints for frontend interaction.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Database Schema Design:** Create a new `expenses` table (and potentially `expense_categories` table) in the database to store expense records, including fields for: `id`, `employeeId`, `expenseType`, `amount`, `currency`, `expenseDate`, `description`, `receiptUrl`, `receiptFilename`, `status` (`PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`), `submissionDate`, `approvalDate`, `approverComments`.
- **API Endpoint Development:** Implement RESTful API endpoints for:
    - `POST /api/expenses`: To submit new expense reports.
    - `GET /api/expenses`: To retrieve an employee's expense history.
    - `GET /api/expenses/{id}`: To fetch details of a specific expense.
    - `PUT /api/expenses/{id}`: To update an expense (e.g., status change by an approver).
    - `DELETE /api/expenses/{id}`: To delete an expense.
    - `POST /api/expenses/{id}/receipt`: To handle receipt file uploads.
    - `GET /api/expenses/{id}/receipt`: To download expense receipts.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement proper security measures to ensure only authorized users can access and modify expense data.

## Phase 3: Frontend Integration - Real Data & Advanced UI

**Objective:** To connect the existing frontend UI to the new backend API, enabling the use of real expense data and enhancing the user experience with dynamic features.

**Key Tasks:**
- **Replace Mock Data:** Update the frontend to fetch and display actual expense data from the new API endpoints instead of mock data.
- **Real File Uploads:** Implement actual file upload functionality to the backend storage for receipts.
- **Real-time Updates:** Integrate mechanisms for real-time updates of expense statuses (e.g., after approval).
- **Form Validation:** Enhance frontend form validation for expense submission.
- **Filtering & Sorting:** Add options to filter and sort expenses by status, date, type, etc.
- **Pagination:** Implement pagination for large expense lists.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Workflow Automation

**Objective:** To introduce advanced functionalities and automate workflows to streamline the expense management process for both employees and administrators.

**Key Features:**
- **Approval Workflow:** Implement a multi-step approval process for expenses, allowing managers/HR to review and approve/reject submissions.
- **Notifications:** Set up email or in-app notifications for expense status changes (submission, approval, rejection).
- **Reporting:** Develop reporting tools for administrators to view expense trends, total expenditures, and compliance.
- **Integration with Payroll:** Explore potential integration with the payroll system for automated reimbursement processing.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Optimize the expense management UI for various screen sizes and devices.
- **Policy Enforcement:** Implement rules and alerts based on company expense policies (e.g., spending limits, required receipts).

This roadmap provides a clear path for the continued development of a comprehensive expense management solution within the Dutch Payroll System.
