const proRataFactor = workingDays / totalDaysInMonth
const proRataSalary = monthlySalary * proRataFactor
```

### **2. Payroll API Integration**
**File:** `src/app/api/payroll/route.ts`

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Automatic pro-rata detection for mid-month starts
- ✅ Detailed calculation logging
- ✅ Pro-rata details included in API responses
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

### **3. Database Schema**
**Status:** No changes required - existing schema supports pro-rata calculations

## 🧪 TESTING RESULTS

### **Mathematical Verification:**
```
Employee: Cihat Kaya
Start Date: August 11, 2025
Monthly Salary: €3,500
Total Days in August: 31
Working Days (Aug 11-31): 21

Calculation:
Daily Rate = €3,500 ÷ 31 = €112.90
Pro-Rata Salary = €112.90 × 21 = €2,483.87
Overpayment Fixed = €3,500 - €2,483.87 = €1,016.13
```
