# SalarySync - Trial Activation & Authentication Fix Report

**Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **Resolved**

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the investigation and resolution of a critical issue preventing new users from accessing the payroll system due to a failed trial activation process. The root cause was identified as a combination of a broken registration flow and a misconfigured authentication system.

After a comprehensive debugging process, the following key issues were resolved:

- **Trial Subscription Creation**: The user registration process now automatically creates and activates a 14-day free trial for all new companies.
- **NextAuth.js Authentication**: The authentication system has been fixed to properly create JWT tokens and manage user sessions, enabling access to protected API routes.
- **Session Management**: User sessions now correctly include company and role information, ensuring proper access control.

**The Dutch payroll system is now fully functional.** New users can successfully register, activate a trial, and access all features, including the payroll dashboard.

## 2. Problem Description

Newly registered users were unable to access the `/payroll` page. The application would get stuck in a loop, indicating that the trial subscription was not being activated correctly. This was a major blocker for any further development or user testing.

**Initial Symptoms:**
- Payroll page not loading for new accounts.
- The `TrialGuard` component was blocking access.
- The `/api/trial/status` endpoint was returning an inactive trial status.

## 3. Investigation & Root Cause Analysis

The investigation followed a step-by-step process to isolate the issue:

### 3.1. Trial Activation Failure

A test script (`test-new-user-trial.js`) was created to simulate the new user signup flow. The test confirmed that **no trial subscription was being created during the registration process.**

**Root Cause:**
- The `/api/auth/register` endpoint had a faulty trial creation logic:
  - It used an incorrect field name (`trialEndsAt` instead of `trialEnd`).
  - It was missing several required fields (`isTrialActive`, `trialStart`, etc.).
  - It failed silently if the `Trial` plan didn't exist in the database.

### 3.2. Authentication & Session Issues

After fixing the trial creation, a new issue emerged: authenticated API routes were returning `401 Unauthorized` errors. This indicated a problem with the NextAuth.js session management.

**Root Cause:**
- The NextAuth.js `authorize` function was not being called during the sign-in process.
- The JWT (JSON Web Token) was not being populated with the necessary user and company information.
- The middleware was correctly blocking access to protected routes because of the missing JWT token.

Further investigation revealed that the NextAuth.js credentials provider was misconfigured, preventing the `authorize` function from being executed.

## 4. Implemented Solutions

### 4.1. Registration & Trial Subscription Fix

The `/api/auth/register` endpoint was updated to ensure a seamless trial activation experience:

- **Transactional Integrity**: The creation of the user, company, and trial subscription now occurs within a single database transaction to ensure data consistency.
- **Corrected Subscription Model**: The subscription creation now uses the correct field names and populates all required data, including `isTrialActive`, `trialStart`, and `trialEnd`.
- **Robust Plan Handling**: The system now checks if a `Trial` plan exists and creates one if it's missing, preventing silent failures.

### 4.2. NextAuth.js Authentication Fix

The NextAuth.js configuration (`src/lib/auth.ts`) was completely overhauled to fix the authentication and session management issues:

- **Provider Configuration**: The `CredentialsProvider` was explicitly configured with `id: "credentials"` to ensure it's correctly matched during the sign-in process.
- **Enhanced `authorize` Function**: The `authorize` function now includes detailed logging and robust logic to retrieve user and company information from the database.
- **JWT & Session Callbacks**: The `jwt` and `session` callbacks were updated to correctly populate the JWT token and session object with all necessary data, including `companyId`, `companyName`, and `companyRole`.
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled NextAuth.js debug mode in the development environment for better visibility into the authentication flow.

## 5. Verification & Testing

A series of test scripts were created to verify the fixes:

- `test-new-user-trial.js`: Confirmed that new users get a trial subscription.
- `test-registration-fix.js`: Verified the updated registration API.
- `test-complete-signup-flow.js`: Tested the entire user journey from signup to payroll access.
- `test-nextauth-debug.js`: Helped debug the NextAuth.js authentication flow.

**Final Test Results:**
- ✅ **PASS:** New user registration successfully creates a user, company, and active 14-day trial subscription.
- ✅ **PASS:** Users can successfully sign in and create a valid session with all necessary company information.
- ✅ **PASS:** Authenticated users can access protected API routes like `/api/trial/status` and `/api/employees`.
- ✅ **PASS:** The payroll page now loads correctly for all new users with an active trial.

## 6. Final System Status

**The Dutch payroll system is now stable and fully functional.** The critical trial activation and authentication issues have been resolved. The development team can now confidently move forward with building new features.

**Current State:**
- **Authentication**: Robust and secure with NextAuth.js and JWT.
- **Trial Management**: Automated and reliable for all new users.
- **API Access**: Properly protected with middleware and session validation.
- **User Experience**: Seamless signup and onboarding process.

This resolution marks a significant milestone in the development of the SalarySync platform, ensuring a solid foundation for future growth and future growth.
