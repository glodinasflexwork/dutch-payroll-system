# Edit Employee Button Connection Fix

## Issue Description

The "Edit Employee" button on the employee detail page was not functional. When clicked, nothing happened, even though the button was visible in the UI.

## Root Cause

The button was missing the `onClick` event handler to navigate to the existing edit employee page. The edit functionality already existed in the system at `/dashboard/employees/[id]/edit`, but the button on the detail page was not connected to this route.

## Implemented Fix

Added an `onClick` event handler to the Edit Employee button that navigates to the existing edit page:

```jsx
// Before
<Button size="sm" className="flex items-center space-x-2">
  <Edit className="w-4 h-4" />
  <span>Edit Employee</span>
</Button>

// After
<Button size="sm" className="flex items-center space-x-2" onClick={() => router.push(`/dashboard/employees/${employee?.id}/edit`)}>
  <Edit className="w-4 h-4" />
  <span>Edit Employee</span>
</Button>
```

This change connects the button to the existing edit functionality, allowing users to easily edit employee information directly from the detail page.

## Deployment

The fix was deployed to GitHub with commit hash `e2344a5` on August 11, 2025.

## Impact

This fix enhances the user experience by:

1. Making the Edit Employee button functional
2. Providing a direct path from viewing to editing employee information
3. Improving workflow efficiency for HR administrators
4. Ensuring all UI elements behave as expected

## User Flow

The complete user flow for editing an employee is now:

1. View employee list
2. Click on an employee to view details
3. Click "Edit Employee" button on the detail page
4. Make changes on the edit page
5. Save changes to return to the detail page

This creates a seamless, intuitive experience for managing employee information.
