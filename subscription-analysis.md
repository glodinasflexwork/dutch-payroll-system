- **CTA**: Get Started

## MAJOR INCONSISTENCIES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Pricing Discrepancies
- **Public Site Starter**: ‚Ç¨29 per employee/month
- **Dashboard Basic**: ‚Ç¨0.2999/month (clearly wrong)

### 2. Employee Limits Mismatch
- **Public Site Starter**: Up to 10 employees
- **Dashboard Basic**: Up to 25 employees

### 3. Missing Plans
- **Public Site**: Shows Starter, Professional (‚Ç¨39), Enterprise (Custom)
- **Dashboard**: Only shows Free Trial and Basic Plan

### 4. Data Display Errors
- **"null payrolls per year"** appears in dashboard
- **Pricing format issues** (‚Ç¨0.2999 instead of ‚Ç¨29.99)

### 5. Trial System Issues
- **Public Site**: 14-day free trial, no credit card required
- **Dashboard**: Shows Free Trial as ‚Ç¨0/month but unclear trial duration/status

## Trial System Analysis Needed
- Check trial duration tracking
- Verify trial expiration logic
- Test trial-to-paid conversion flow
- Validate trial status display


## DETAILED INCONSISTENCY ANALYSIS

### 1. Plan Structure Mismatch
**Public Site (pricing/page.tsx):**
- Starter: ‚Ç¨29/month, up to 10 employees
- Professional: ‚Ç¨39/month, up to 100 employees  
- Enterprise: Custom pricing, unlimited employees

**Dashboard (subscription/page.tsx):**
- Fetches plans from `/api/plans` (database-driven)
- Shows "Free Trial" and "Basic Plan" only
- Prices: ‚Ç¨0/month and ‚Ç¨0.2999/month (clearly wrong)

### 2. Database vs Hardcoded Data
**Problem:** Public site uses hardcoded pricing, dashboard uses database
**Result:** Completely different plan information displayed

### 3. Price Format Issues
**Dashboard Issues:**
- ‚Ç¨0.2999/month instead of ‚Ç¨29.99/month
- Suggests price is stored in cents but displayed incorrectly
- "null payrolls per year" indicates missing/malformed data

### 4. Trial System Problems
**Public Site:** 14-day free trial, no credit card required
**Dashboard:** Shows "Free Trial" as a plan option, unclear trial status

### 5. Missing Plan Synchronization
**Root Cause:** No synchronization between:
- Public marketing site (hardcoded)
- Database plan records
- Stripe product/price IDs

## REQUIRED FIXES

### Phase 3 Action Items:
1. **Synchronize Plan Data**
   - Update database with correct plan information
   - Fix price formatting (cents to euros)
   - Add proper feature lists

2. **Fix Trial System**
   - Implement proper trial tracking
   - Show trial status and remaining days
   - Handle trial expiration

3. **Unify Plan Display**
   - Make public site use same data source as dashboard
   - Or ensure database matches public site exactly

4. **Fix Data Issues**
   - Replace "null payrolls per year" with proper values
   - Fix price display formatting
   - Add missing plan features


## TEST RESULTS AFTER FIXES

### ‚úÖ IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
1. **Fixed Plan Data**: Database now has correct plans (Free Trial, Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
2. **Fixed Pricing**: Prices now show correctly (‚Ç¨0, ‚Ç¨29, ‚Ç¨39, ‚Ç¨0)
3. **Fixed Features**: Proper feature lists instead of "null payrolls per year"
4. **Trial System**: User has active trial with 8 days remaining

### ‚ùå REMAINING ISSUES:
1. **Plan Display Order**: Shows "Free Trial, Enterprise, Basic Plan" instead of logical order
2. **Missing Plans**: "Starter" and "Professional" plans not showing in dashboard
3. **Wrong Plan Names**: Shows "Basic Plan" instead of "Starter" 
4. **Price Format**: Still shows "‚Ç¨0.2999" for Basic Plan (should be deactivated)
5. **Current Subscription Status**: No indication that user is currently on Free Trial

### üîç ROOT CAUSE:
The subscription page is still showing old cached plans or not filtering inactive plans properly. The API is returning all plans including the deactivated "Basic Plan".

### üìã ADDITIONAL FIXES NEEDED:
1. Filter out inactive plans in the API
2. Sort plans in logical order (Free Trial, Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
3. Show current subscription status prominently
4. Display trial remaining days
5. Ensure plan names match public site exactly



## FINAL TEST RESULTS AFTER ALL FIXES

### ‚úÖ MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED:
1. **Free Trial Hidden**: ‚úÖ Free Trial no longer shows as selectable option (correctly hidden)
2. **All 3 Plans Visible**: ‚úÖ Starter (‚Ç¨29), Professional (‚Ç¨39), Enterprise (‚Ç¨0) all display properly
3. **Correct Pricing**: ‚úÖ All prices show correctly formatted
4. **Proper Features**: ‚úÖ All feature lists display properly (no more "null payrolls")
5. **Logical Order**: ‚úÖ Plans show in correct sequence: Starter ‚Üí Professional ‚Üí Enterprise

### ‚ùå REMAINING ISSUES:
1. **Current Subscription Status**: The enhanced trial status banner is not displaying
2. **Trial Upgrade Banner**: The prominent trial upgrade banner is not showing
3. **Button Text**: Buttons still show "Get Started" instead of "Upgrade from Trial"

### üîç ROOT CAUSE:
The subscription status components are not loading, likely because:
- `currentSubscription` data is not being fetched properly
- The subscription API might not be returning the trial subscription data
- Component state might not be updating after the database fixes

### üìã NEXT STEPS:
1. Check if the subscription API is returning the current subscription data
2. Verify the subscription loading logic in the component
3. Ensure the trial subscription is properly linked to the user
