# Database Query Analysis and Optimization Opportunities

## Current Query Patterns Analysis

### Dashboard Page Performance Issues

The dashboard page (`/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) exhibits several performance bottlenecks:

1. **Sequential API Calls**: The `fetchDashboardStats` function makes 3 separate API calls:
   - `/api/companies` - Company information
   - `/api/employees` - All employee data
   - `/api/payroll` - All payroll records

2. **Client-Side Data Processing**: Employee filtering (monthly vs hourly) happens on the client side after fetching all employee data.

3. **No Caching**: Each page load triggers fresh API calls with no caching mechanism.

### Employees Page Performance Issues

The employees page (`/src/app/dashboard/employees/page.tsx`) has similar issues:

1. **Full Employee Data Fetch**: Loads all employee data regardless of pagination needs
2. **Client-Side Filtering**: Search and department filtering happens after data fetch
3. **No Lazy Loading**: All employee data loaded upfront

### API Route Inefficiencies

The employees API route (`/src/app/api/employees/route.ts`) shows several optimization opportunities:

1. **Subscription Validation Overhead**: Multiple database calls for subscription checking
2. **No Query Optimization**: Simple `findMany` without selective field loading
3. **No Pagination**: Returns all employees regardless of count
4. **Redundant Validation**: Multiple existence checks that could be combined

## Identified Performance Bottlenecks

### 1. Database Connection Management
- Multiple Prisma client instances without connection pooling
- No connection reuse between requests
- Potential connection exhaustion under load

### 2. Query Optimization
- No selective field loading (SELECT *)
- Missing database indexes on frequently queried fields
- No query result caching

### 3. Data Transfer Optimization
- Full employee objects returned when summary data would suffice
- No compression for API responses
- Redundant data in API responses

### 4. Client-Side Processing
- Heavy computation on client side that should be server-side
- Multiple re-renders due to sequential data loading
- No optimistic updates or skeleton loading states
