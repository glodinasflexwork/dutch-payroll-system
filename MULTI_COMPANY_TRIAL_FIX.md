# Multi-Company Trial Access Fix

## üö® Problem Summary

The Dutch payroll system was experiencing "Access Required" errors when users tried to access payroll functionality, despite having active trial subscriptions. The issue was specifically related to multi-company trial validation logic.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Results

**User**: `cihatkaya@glodinas.nl`  
**Session Company ID**: `cmdc3brge0003o4f9rzjiodzm` ‚ùå (non-existent in database)  
**User's Actual Companies**: 4 companies with active trials  

**Companies with Active Trials**:
1. **Glodinas Finance B.V.** (ID: cmdbgs8ip0000lb0aqs85o8g1) - Owner role
2. **Tech Solutions B.V.** (ID: cmdebowu10000o4lmq3wm34wn) - Owner role  
3. **Marketing Plus** (ID: cmdebozmu0003o4lmwcfvc2e8) - Admin role
4. **Consulting Group** (ID: cmdebp0qt0006o4lmftdhcq03) - HR Manager role

### Core Issue

The trial status API (`/api/trial/status`) was using a rigid company resolution approach:
1. Only checked the `session.user.companyId` 
2. If that company didn't exist or had no trial, it would fail
3. Ignored other companies the user had access to with active trials

This caused the trial validation to fail even when the user had legitimate access to companies with active trials.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Smart Company Resolution Logic

Modified `/api/trial/status` route to implement a three-step fallback mechanism:

#### Step 1: Session Company Validation
```typescript
// Check if session companyId exists and has active trial
if (companyId) {
  resolvedCompany = await authClient.company.findUnique({
    where: { id: companyId },
    include: { Subscription: true, UserCompany: {...} }
  });
  
  if (resolvedCompany?.Subscription?.isTrialActive) {
    // Use session company
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: User Primary Company Fallback
```typescript
// Fallback to user's primary companyId if session company invalid
if (!resolvedCompany) {
  const user = await authClient.user.findUnique({
    where: { id: session.user.id },
    select: { companyId: true }
  });
  
  if (user?.companyId && user.companyId !== companyId) {
    // Check user's primary company for active trial
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Any Valid Company Fallback
```typescript
// Final fallback - find ANY company user has access to with active trial
if (!resolvedCompany) {
  const userCompanies = await authClient.userCompany.findMany({
    where: { userId: session.user.id },
    include: { Company: { include: { Subscription: true } } }
  });
  
  const companyWithTrial = userCompanies.find(uc => 
    uc.Company.Subscription?.isTrialActive
  );
}
```

### Enhanced Response Data

Added `resolvedCompany` information to API responses:
```typescript
{
  trial: { isActive: true, daysRemaining: 7, ... },
  hasSubscription: false,
  subscription: null,
  resolvedCompany: {
    id: companyId,
    name: resolvedCompany.name
  },
  message: 'Trial active - full access to all features'
}
```

## üìä Validation Results

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå "Access Required" error on payroll page
- ‚ùå Trial validation failing despite active trials
- ‚ùå Session pointing to non-existent company
- ‚ùå Payroll functionality completely blocked

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ **Trial validation working**: Smart company resolution finds valid trial
- ‚úÖ **Payroll page accessible**: No more "Access Required" errors
- ‚úÖ **Company resolved**: Tech Solutions B.V. (cmdebowu10000o4lmq3wm34wn)
- ‚úÖ **Trial status active**: 7 days remaining, full access granted
- ‚úÖ **Payroll calculation attempted**: System allows payroll processing

### Console Output Validation
```
Trial data received: {trial: Object, hasSubscription: false, subscription: null, resolvedCompany: Object, message: Trial active - full access to all features}
Trial status: {isActive: true, daysRemaining: 7, daysUsed: 7, startDate: 2025-07-24T18:42:26.990Z, endDate: 2025-08-07T18:42:26.990Z}
Trial is active - granting access

## üéØ Business Impact

### User Experience
- **Seamless multi-company access**: Users can access trial features regardless of which company they're viewing
- **Automatic resolution**: No manual intervention required when session points to invalid company
- **Consistent behavior**: Trial validation works reliably across all user companies

### Technical Benefits
- **Robust error handling**: Graceful fallback when session data is corrupted
- **Future-proof**: Handles company deletion, session corruption, and multi-company scenarios
- **Backward compatible**: Existing single-company setups continue to work
- **Detailed logging**: Comprehensive debug output for troubleshooting

## üîß Files Modified

1. **`/src/app/api/trial/status/route.ts`**
   - Added smart company resolution logic
   - Implemented three-step fallback mechanism
   - Enhanced response with resolved company information
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

- **Zero downtime**: Changes are backward compatible
- **No database migrations**: Only API logic changes
- **Session handling**: Automatically resolves invalid session company references
- **Multi-tenant safe**: Respects user permissions and company access rights

## üìã Future Enhancements

1. **Session Update Mechanism**: Consider updating session to point to resolved company
2. **Company Switching API**: Dedicated endpoint for explicit company context switching
3. **Trial Inheritance**: Explore trial sharing across related companies
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Interface for managing multi-company trial access
