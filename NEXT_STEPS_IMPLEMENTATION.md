## 🎯 **Current Status**
- ✅ **New employee creation form** - Birth date and gender fields working

- ❌ **Employee edit form** - Missing birth date and gender fields
- ❌ **Existing employees** - No birth date/gender data yet

## 📋 **Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### **1. Fix Employee Edit Form** 🔧
**Priority: HIGH - Critical for usability**

**What's needed:**
- Update `/dashboard/employees/[id]/edit/page.tsx` to include birth date and gender fields
- Add proper validation for these fields
- Ensure form submission includes the new fields

**Why important:**
- Users need to be able to edit existing employee information
- Currently shows "Employee Not Found" error

### **2. Update Employee API Endpoints** 🔌
**Priority: HIGH - Required for functionality**

**What's needed:**
- Update `/api/employees/route.ts` to handle birth date and gender in PUT requests
- Ensure database queries include the new fields
- Add proper validation on the backend

**Why important:**
- Edit form won't work without API support
- Profile page won't display data without API returning it

### **3. Add Birth Date & Gender to Existing Employees** 👥
**Priority: MEDIUM - For immediate testing**

**What's needed:**
- Create a migration script to add default/placeholder values
- Or manually edit Cihat's record to test the functionality

**Why important:**
- You'll be able to see the fields working immediately
- Can test the complete workflow

### **4. Update Payslip Generation** 📄
**Priority: MEDIUM - For legal compliance**

**What's needed:**
- Update payslip template to use employee birth date and gender
- Show "Geboortedatum: 15-05-1990" and "De heer/Mevrouw" on payslips

**Why important:**
- Legal compliance for Dutch payslips
- Professional appearance
