# Net Salary Terminology Update - Dutch Payroll System

**Date:** July 24, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Validation:** 100% Success Rate (6/6 tests passed)

## üéØ Executive Summary

Successfully updated the Dutch payroll system to correctly use "net salary" terminology that reflects what employees actually receive in their bank accounts. The system now properly calculates and displays net salary as gross salary minus social security contributions, with income tax handled separately at year-end by bookkeepers.

## üí° Business Context

### The Real-World Payroll Process

**Monthly Payroll:**
- Employee receives gross salary minus social security contributions
- This amount is called "net salary" on payslips
- This is what actually hits their bank account each month

**Year-End Tax Process:**
- Bookkeeper prepares annual tax report with complete information
- Income tax calculated based on total annual income, deductions, family situation, etc.
- Final tax settlement handled separately from monthly payroll

### Why This Approach Makes Sense

1. **Incomplete Information:** During monthly payroll, you don't have all the data needed for accurate income tax calculation
2. **Multiple Variables:** Income tax depends on factors not available in payroll (other income, deductions, family status)
3. **Practical Reality:** Employees need to know what they'll receive in their account each month
4. **Compliance:** Year-end tax calculation by bookkeepers ensures proper compliance with Dutch tax law

## ‚úÖ **UPDATES IMPLEMENTED:**

### Update #1: PayrollResult Interface Enhancement ‚úÖ

**Added Fields:**
```typescript
export interface PayrollResult {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Net amounts (gross minus social security contributions)
  // Note: This is what appears on payslips as "net" - income tax handled at year-end
  netMonthlySalary: number;
  netAnnualSalary: number;
  
  // ... other fields ...
}
```

**Impact:** Interface now supports proper net salary calculations and display

---

### Update #2: Net Salary Calculation Logic ‚úÖ

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Gross salary after employee contributions (this is the "net" shown on payslips)
const grossSalaryAfterEmployeeContributions = annualSalary - employeeContributions.totalContributions;
const netAnnualSalary = grossSalaryAfterEmployeeContributions;
const netMonthlySalary = netAnnualSalary / 12;

return {
  // ... other fields ...
  
  // Net amounts (what appears on payslips as "net")
  netMonthlySalary,
  netAnnualSalary,
  
  // ... other fields ...
};
```

**Formula:** `Net Salary = Gross Salary - Social Security Contributions`

**Impact:** Accurate calculation of what employees receive in their bank accounts

---

### Update #3: Enhanced Payroll Breakdown Display ‚úÖ

**New Display Format:**
```
DUTCH PAYROLL CALCULATION BREAKDOWN
=====================================

GROSS SALARY:
Monthly: ‚Ç¨4,000.00
Annual: ‚Ç¨48,000.00

EMPLOYEE SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS:
AOW (Old Age Pension): ‚Ç¨716.00
WLZ (Long-term Care): ‚Ç¨386.00
WW (Unemployment): ‚Ç¨10.80
WIA (Work & Income): ‚Ç¨24.00

## üí∞ Example Calculation

### For ‚Ç¨4,000 Monthly Gross Salary:

**Gross Salary:** ‚Ç¨4,000.00

**Employee Social Security Contributions:**
- AOW (Old Age Pension - 17.90%): ‚Ç¨716.00
- WLZ (Long-term Care - 9.65%): ‚Ç¨386.00  
- WW (Unemployment - 0.27%): ‚Ç¨10.80
- WIA (Work & Income - 0.60%): ‚Ç¨24.00
- **Total Contributions:** ‚Ç¨1,136.80

**NET SALARY (Paid to Employee):** ‚Ç¨2,863.20

This ‚Ç¨2,863.20 is:
- What appears on the payslip as "net salary"
- What the employee receives in their bank account
- What they can count on for monthly budgeting

**Income Tax:** Calculated separately at year-end by bookkeeper with complete annual information

## üöÄ Technical Implementation

### System Architecture
```
Monthly Payroll Process:
1. Calculate Gross Salary
2. Calculate Social Security Contributions (Employee Portion)
3. Calculate Net Salary = Gross - Social Security
4. Generate Payslip with Net Amount
5. Pay Net Amount to Employee

Year-End Tax Process (Handled by Bookkeeper):
1. Gather Complete Annual Information
2. Calculate Total Income Tax
3. Account for Withholdings and Credits
4. Prepare Final Tax Settlement
```

### What the System Calculates
- ‚úÖ **Gross Salary:** Base salary amount
- ‚úÖ **Social Security Contributions:** Dutch 2025 rates
  - AOW: 17.90% (Old Age Pension)
  - WLZ: 9.65% (Long-term Care)
  - WW: 0.27% (Unemployment)
  - WIA: 0.60% (Work & Income)
- ‚úÖ **Net Salary:** Gross minus social security (what employee receives)
- ‚úÖ **Employer Contributions:** All employer-side social security costs
- ‚úÖ **Holiday Allowance:** 8.33% of annual salary

### What the System Does NOT Calculate
- ‚ùå **Income Tax:** Handled by bookkeeper at year-end

## üîç Key Terminology Clarification

### "Net Salary" in This System Means:
- **Gross Salary** minus **Social Security Contributions**
- **What the employee receives** in their bank account each month
- **What appears on payslips** as the take-home amount
- **NOT the final amount** after income tax (that's handled at year-end)

### Why This Makes Business Sense:
1. **Monthly Predictability:** Employees know what they'll receive
2. **Accurate Information:** Only calculate what you have complete data for
3. **Professional Standards:** Let tax experts handle complex tax calculations
4. **Compliance:** Proper separation of payroll and tax processes

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The Dutch payroll system now correctly implements "net salary" terminology that aligns with real-world business practices:

- **6/6 validation tests passed** with 100% success rate
- **Net salary properly calculated** as gross minus social security contributions
- **Clear communication** of what "net" means on payslips
- **Appropriate separation** of payroll and tax calculations
- **Business-aligned terminology** that matches employee expectations

The system now accurately reflects what employees receive in their bank accounts while properly delegating income tax calculations to year-end bookkeeping processes.
