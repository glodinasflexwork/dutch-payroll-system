# Dutch Payroll System - Development Log

This document outlines the development work performed on the Dutch Payroll System, focusing on the implementation of an optional employee invitation system, and addressing various issues encountered during the process.

## 1. Changes Implemented

### 1.1 Database Schema Updates (`prisma/hr.prisma`)
- **Added `portalAccessStatus` to `Employee` model:** This new field (`enum PortalAccessStatus { NO_ACCESS, INVITED, ACTIVE }`) allows tracking the portal access status of an employee independently of their creation.
- **Added `invitedAt` to `Employee` model:** A `DateTime` field to record when an invitation was last sent.
- **Removed `EmployeePortalAccess` model:** Simplified the HR schema by integrating portal access status directly into the `Employee` model.
- **Regenerated Prisma Client:** Ran `npx prisma generate --schema=prisma/hr.prisma` to reflect schema changes in the client.

### 1.2 Backend API Modifications
- **`/src/lib/billingGuard.ts` (New File):** Implemented a `BillingGuard` service to centralize subscription limit checks for features like sending portal invitations. This allows for flexible pricing models (e.g., per-seat, slot-based).
- **`/src/app/api/employees/invite/route.ts` (New File):** Created a dedicated API endpoint for sending employee invitations. This endpoint uses the `BillingGuard` to enforce subscription limits and sends the actual invitation email.
- **`/src/app/api/employees/route.ts` (Modified):**
    - Modified the `POST` endpoint to set `portalAccessStatus` to `NO_ACCESS` by default when creating a new employee.
    - Removed direct subscription checks from this endpoint, as they are now handled by the `BillingGuard` and the new `/api/employees/invite` endpoint.
- **`/src/app/api/payroll/route.ts` (Modified):**
    - **Fixed `getServerSession is not defined` error:** Correctly imported `getServerSession` and `authOptions`.
    - **Fixed Prisma query error:** Changed `orderBy` and `where` clauses in the `GET` endpoint to use `createdAt` instead of `payPeriodStart` (which was not a valid field in the `PayrollRecord` model), resolving a Prisma validation error.

### 1.3 Frontend UI Enhancements (`src/app/dashboard/employees/add/page.tsx`)
- **Reverted to original file:** The `add employee` page was reverted to its original state from the GitHub repository to ensure a clean base.
- **`EmployeeFormData` interface:** Added `sendInvitation: boolean` to the form data interface.
- **`STEPS` array:** Included a new "Portal Access" step (Step 5) with an associated icon (`Mail`).
- **`formData` initialization:** Initialized `sendInvitation` to `false` in the `useState` hook.
- **`renderStepContent` function:** Implemented the UI for the "Portal Access" step, including a checkbox for `sendInvitation` and a descriptive note about subscription implications.

## 2. Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### 2.1 Server Crash / 500 Error on Initial Access
- **Cause:** Database schema mismatch after adding `portalAccessStatus` and `invitedAt` fields without running Prisma migrations.
- **Resolution:** Executed `npx prisma migrate dev` to update the database schema.

### 2.2 Dashboard Displaying 0 Employees
- **Cause:** Initially, a `ReferenceError: getServerSession is not defined` in `/api/payroll/route.ts` caused the payroll API call to fail, leading the dashboard's `fetchDashboardStats` function to fall into its error handling and display 0 for all statistics.
- **Resolution:** Fixed the `getServerSession` import and usage in `/api/payroll/route.ts`.
- **Subsequent Cause:** A Prisma validation error (`Unknown argument 'payPeriodStart'`) in the `orderBy` clause of the `GET /api/payroll` endpoint, as `payPeriodStart` was not a direct field on the `PayrollRecord` model for ordering.
- **Resolution:** Changed the `orderBy` and `where` clauses in `GET /api/payroll` to use `createdAt`, which is a valid field.

### 2.3 "Add Employee" Page Crashing / Missing Checkbox
- **Cause (Crash):** A syntax error (`Unterminated regexp literal`) in the `emailRegex` within `src/app/dashboard/employees/add/page.tsx` was causing the page to crash.
- **Resolution (Crash):** Corrected the `emailRegex` syntax.
- **Cause (Missing Checkbox):** The `renderStepContent` function for the "Portal Access" step (case 5) was not correctly implemented to display the checkbox and related UI elements.
- **Resolution (Missing Checkbox):** Manually added the JSX for the `sendInvitation` checkbox and its descriptive text within the `renderStepContent` function for `case 5`.

### 2.4 Server Access Issues
- **Cause:** Intermittent issues with the sandbox environment or the development server process stopping unexpectedly.
- **Resolution:** Repeatedly restarted the `npm run dev` process and killed previous processes to ensure a clean start.

## 3. Remaining Tasks

1.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire flow:
    *   Create employees *without* sending invitations.
    *   Create employees *with* sending invitations (verify email in Mailtrap).
    *   Test the `BillingGuard` functionality (if possible to simulate subscription limits).
    *   Verify the dashboard now correctly displays employee counts and other statistics.
2.  **Employee List Enhancements:**
    *   Add a button/option to send invitations to existing employees from the employee list.
    *   Display the `portalAccessStatus` for each employee in the list.
    *   Implement functionality to resend invitations.
3.  **Email Service Integration:** Ensure the `sendEmployeeInvitationEmail` function is fully implemented and integrated with a real email service (beyond Mailtrap for testing).
4.  **Database Migrations (Production):** If these changes are to be deployed, proper database migration scripts will need to be run on the production environment.
5.  **Refinement of `BillingGuard`:** Further integrate the `BillingGuard` with actual subscription data and logic (e.g., fetching current subscription tier, available slots).

## 4. How to Run Locally

To set up and run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/glodinasflexwork/dutch-payroll-system.git
    cd dutch-payroll-system
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the necessary environment variables (as provided previously, including database URLs, Mailtrap tokens, Stripe keys, etc.).
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run Prisma Migrations:** Apply the database schema changes.
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --schema=prisma/hr.prisma
    npx prisma migrate dev --schema=prisma/payroll.prisma # Ensure payroll schema is also up-to-date
    ```
5.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
6.  **Access the Application:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the exposed URL if running in a sandbox).
