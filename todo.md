# Bug Fixing Progress

## Phase 1: Fix missing payrollClient imports in employee portal routes
- [x] Check employee-portal/me/route.ts for missing payrollClient import
- [x] Check employee-portal/payslips/route.ts for missing payrollClient import  
- [x] Check employee-portal/route.ts for missing payrollClient import
- [x] Add proper payrollClient imports where needed
- [ ] Verify imports work correctly

## Phase 2: Fix schema mismatch between portalAccess and portalAccessStatus
- [x] Analyze current schema for portalAccessStatus field
- [x] Update employee portal routes to use correct field name
- [x] Fix TypeScript errors related to field mismatch
- [x] Ensure consistent usage across all routes

## Phase 3: Test and validate all bug fixes
- [x] Run TypeScript compilation check
- [x] Test employee portal API endpoints
- [x] Verify payslip access functionality
- [x] Check for any new runtime errors

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Build completed successfully - no blocking errors
- ✅ Development server starts without critical errors
- ✅ Employee portal routes respond correctly (authentication required as expected)
- ✅ payrollClient imports are working (no import errors in runtime)
- ✅ portalAccessStatus field usage is correct (no schema mismatch errors)

## Phase 4: Commit and push fixes to GitHub
- [ ] Create comprehensive commit message
- [ ] Push all fixes to repository
- [ ] Document changes made

## Notes:
- Do NOT remove unused variables/imports without user confirmation (may be incomplete features)
- Focus on critical runtime bugs first
- Preserve existing functionality while fixing bugs
