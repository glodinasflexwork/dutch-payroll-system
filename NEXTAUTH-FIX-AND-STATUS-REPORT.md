# NextAuth.js Authentication and Session Fix Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the investigation and resolution of critical authentication and session management issues within the Dutch payroll system. The primary problem was the inability to access protected routes, such as the payroll dashboard, despite having an active trial subscription. The root cause was a misconfiguration in the NextAuth.js setup, specifically a conflict between the `database` session strategy and the `CredentialsProvider`.

This report outlines the steps taken to diagnose the problem, the fixes implemented, and the current status of the system. The authentication flow has been successfully repaired, and the system is now ready for further testing and development.

## 2. Problem Analysis

The initial symptoms were:

- Users could not access the `/payroll` page, even with a valid and active trial subscription.
- The application was returning 500 Internal Server Errors on protected routes.
- The NextAuth.js session was not being correctly established or recognized by the application.

### Key Findings:

- **Unsupported Session Strategy**: The core issue was the use of the `database` session strategy with the `CredentialsProvider`. The `CredentialsProvider` in NextAuth.js requires the `jwt` session strategy to be enabled. The `database` strategy is designed for use with OAuth providers, not for credential-based authentication.
- **Incorrect `next.config.js` Configuration**: The `next.config.js` file contained deprecated experimental features (`serverComponentsExternalPackages` and `outputFileTracingIncludes` under the `experimental` key), which were causing warnings and potential instability.
- **Lingering Processes**: The development server process was not always terminating correctly, leading to "address already in use" errors and preventing the application from restarting with the new configuration.
- **Incorrect Database Client Usage**: The test scripts were using incorrect import paths and field names for the Prisma database clients, which led to errors when testing the authentication flow.

## 3. Implemented Solutions

The following fixes were implemented to address the issues:

### 3.1. NextAuth.js Configuration (`src/lib/auth.ts`)

- **Switched to JWT Session Strategy**: The session strategy was changed from `database` to `jwt` to support the `CredentialsProvider`.
- **Updated JWT and Session Callbacks**: The `jwt` and `session` callbacks were updated to correctly handle the user data and populate the session with the necessary company information.
- **Removed PrismaAdapter**: The `PrismaAdapter` was removed from the configuration as it is not needed with the `jwt` strategy.

### 3.2. `next.config.js` Cleanup

- **Removed Deprecated Features**: The deprecated `experimental` features were removed from the `next.config.js` file and replaced with the current, stable options.

### 3.3. Test Script Corrections

- **Corrected Prisma Client Usage**: The test scripts were updated to use the correct import paths, environment variables, and model field names for the Prisma clients.

### 3.4. Process Management

- **Forceful Process Termination**: Implemented steps to forcefully kill lingering processes using `fuser` and `kill` commands to ensure a clean restart of the development server.

## 4. Current System Status

- **Authentication Flow**: The authentication flow is now working correctly. Users can sign in with their credentials, and a JWT session is successfully created.
- **API Endpoints**: The NextAuth.js API endpoints (`/api/auth/providers`, `/api/auth/session`, `/api/auth/signin/credentials`) are all responding correctly.
- **Payroll Access**: The `/payroll` page is now accessible to authenticated users with an active subscription.
- **Development Server**: The development server is stable and running without any critical errors.

## 5. Final Verification

A final test of the authentication flow and payroll access was conducted:

1.  **User Login**: A test user was successfully logged in using the `test-signin-api.js` script.
2.  **Session Verification**: The session was verified to contain the correct user and company information.
3.  **Payroll Page Access**: The `/payroll` page was accessed successfully, and the trial status was correctly identified.

## 6. Conclusion

The authentication and session management issues in the Dutch payroll system have been successfully resolved. The system is now in a stable state, and the core payroll functionality is accessible to authenticated users. The fixes implemented in this task have addressed the root causes of the problems and have improved the overall stability and reliability of the application.
