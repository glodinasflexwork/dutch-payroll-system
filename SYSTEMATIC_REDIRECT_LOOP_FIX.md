# Systematic Redirect Loop Bug Fix

## 🎯 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

Every new user who created their first company would experience a redirect loop between the dashboard and company creation page. This was a **systematic bug** affecting all new user registrations.

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **The Issue:**
1. **Company Creation API** worked correctly - it properly:
   - Created the company
   - Created user-company association (admin role, active)
   - Updated user.companyId in the database

2. **Frontend Session Management** was the problem:
   - After successful company creation, the frontend redirected to `/dashboard`
   - **NextAuth session was NOT refreshed** - still contained old user data (companyId: null)
   - Dashboard authentication middleware saw user without company
   - Redirected back to company creation page
   - **Infinite redirect loop** occurred

### **Why This Affected All New Users:**
- Every new user starts with `companyId: null`
- Company creation updates the database but not the session
- Without session refresh, the updated `companyId` is never picked up
- Authentication middleware always sees the old session data

## 🔧 **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **File Modified:** `src/app/setup/company/page.tsx`

**Key Changes:**
1. **Added session refresh** after successful company creation
2. **Used NextAuth's `update()` function** to force session refresh
3. **Added proper error handling** for session refresh failures
4. **Delayed redirect** to allow session update to complete

### **Code Changes:**

```typescript
// Before (BUGGY):
if (response.ok) {
  setIsSuccess(true)
  setTimeout(() => {
    router.push('/dashboard')
  }, 2000)
}

// After (FIXED):
if (response.ok) {
  setIsSuccess(true)
  
  // CRITICAL FIX: Refresh the session to pick up the new companyId
  try {
    // Force session refresh to get updated user data with companyId
    await update()
    
    // Redirect to dashboard after session refresh
    setTimeout(() => {
      router.push('/dashboard')
    }, 1000)
  } catch (sessionError) {
    // Fallback: redirect anyway after a longer delay
    setTimeout(() => {
      router.push('/dashboard')
    }, 2000)
  }
}
```
